arXiv API User's Manual
https://info.arxiv.org/help/api/user-manual.html
# (...)
# the titles of an article can be searched, as well as the author list, abstracts, comments and journal reference. 
# To search one of these fields, we simply prepend the field prefix followed by a colon to our search term. 
# For example, suppose we wanted to find all articles by the author Adrian Del Maestro. 
# We could construct the following query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro
# This returns nine results. The following table lists the field prefixes for all the fields that can be searched.
# prefix explanation
# ti	 Title
# au	 Author
# abs	 Abstract
# co	 Comment
# jr	 Journal Reference
# cat	 Subject Category
# rn	 Report Number
# id	 Id (use id_list instead)
# all	 All of the above
# (...)
# The API provides one date filter, submittedDate, that allow you to select data within a given date range of when the data was submitted to arXiv. 
# The expected format is [YYYYMMDDTTTT+TO+YYYYMMDDTTTT] were the TTTT is provided in 24 hour time to the minute, in GMT. 
# We could construct the following query using submittedDate.
# https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+AND+submittedDate:[202301010600+TO+202401010600]
